## Technical Overview

Python-based tool that simplifies the creation of Langgraph applications by allowing users to define agent nodes, graphs, and edges using JSON configuration files. This project aims to streamline the process of building and maintaining LangGraph workflows by eliminating the need for extensive manual coding.

## Features

- Easier management and modification of langgraph components.
- Ability to configure Agents, prompts, models and edges.
- Easily validate and test the graphs
- Gradio UI to test the graph
