## Master's in Computer Science - UNC Charlotte (2016-2017)

I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The program provided comprehensive hands-on experience with advanced computing concepts and real-world applications.

### Key Areas of Study

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Advanced algorithmic problem-solving, complexity analysis, and optimization techniques
- **Mobile Application Development**: Building cross-platform mobile applications
- **Cloud Computing**: Distributed systems, cloud architecture, and scalable application design
- **Network-Based Applications**: Network programming, protocols, and distributed computing
- **Software Engineering**: Design patterns, software architecture, and best practices

### Projects & Experience

The master's program challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects. I worked on various applications that helped me understand programming from different perspectives and develop solutions to complex technical problems. Each project strengthened my ability to analyze requirements, design efficient solutions, and implement robust code.
