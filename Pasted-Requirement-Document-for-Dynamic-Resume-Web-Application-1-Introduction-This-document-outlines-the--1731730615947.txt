Requirement Document for Dynamic Resume Web Application
1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a dynamic resume web application using Next.js. The application will allow users to generate a resume website by populating content from Markdown (MD) files. The goal is to create a flexible and extensible platform that can dynamically load user content and present it in an organized, visually appealing manner.

2. Project Overview
Objective: Build a dynamic resume website that reads user details from MD files and displays them using a pre-defined template.
Target Users: Individuals looking to create an online resume or portfolio.
Key Features:
- Dynamic content loading from MD files.
- Organized folder structure for different resume components.
- Consistent layout and styling across all sections.
- Ability to include custom styling and images within MD files.

3. Functional Requirements

3.1 Application Structure
Components: The application will consist of the following main components:
- Contact Information
- Work Experience
- Education
- Projects
- Folder Organization: Each component will have its own folder containing multiple MD files representing individual sections.

	Example:
		/work-experience/experience1.md
		/education/education1.md

3.2 Markdown File Structure
Standardized Format: All MD files must follow a standard structure to ensure consistency.
Required Fields:
- Title: The name of the position, degree, or project.
- Timeline: The duration (e.g., “June 2020 - Present”).
- Summary: A brief description of the role or project.
- Takeaways: Key achievements or learnings.
- Optional Fields:
 
1. Tags: Keywords related to the section.
2. Images: Paths to images to be included.
3. Links: URLs to external resources.

3.3 Data Loading and Processing
Startup Loading: All MD files will be read and processed when the application starts.
Dynamic Content Generation: The application should dynamically generate pages based on the content of the MD files.

3.4 User Interface

	•	Left-Hand Navigation Panel:
	•	Lists all main components.
	•	Allows users to navigate between different sections.
	•	Dashboard:
	•	Serves as the initial landing page.
	•	Provides an overview or summary.
	•	Main Content Area:
	•	Displays the content of the selected component.
	•	Sections are presented as scrollable cards occupying the full right pane.
	•	Cards are rendered sequentially to maintain order.

3.5 Content Rendering

	•	Cards for Sections:
	•	Each section from the MD files is rendered as an individual card.
	•	Cards include all relevant fields (title, timeline, summary, takeaways).
	•	Order Preservation:
	•	Sections are displayed in the order they are defined in the folder structure or via a specified order in the MD files.

3.6 Styling and Media Inclusion

	•	Custom Styling:
	•	Allow inclusion of custom CSS classes or inline styles within MD files if necessary.
	•	Images and Media:
	•	Support embedding images using standard Markdown syntax.
	•	Images should be stored in a dedicated folder and referenced appropriately.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

4.1 Performance

	•	Efficient Loading:
	•	Optimize data fetching and rendering to ensure quick load times.
	•	Responsive Design:
	•	Ensure the application is usable on various devices and screen sizes.



4.2 Maintainability

	•	Clean Code Practices:
	•	Use clear and consistent coding standards.
	•	Documentation:
	•	Provide comprehensive documentation for future developers.

5. Technology Stack
Framework: Next.js
Programming Language: JavaScript
Libraries: remark and remark-html for parsing and converting MD files to HTML.
Styling: CSS Modules, Styled JSX, or styled-components.
