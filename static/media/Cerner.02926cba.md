| _*Cerner Corporation*_ | Software Developer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| `August 2018 - March 2020` | As Software developer in Cerner, I had to undergo an intensive training to get familiar with Cerner code process and also learn latest technologies and testing frameworks. And working with teams and co-ordinating with them gave me a better understanding in team-work and co-ordination. Having worked multiple projects, the learning curve was intensive and helped me keep up with the new technologies and working. |
