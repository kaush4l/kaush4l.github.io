| _*LZW compression*_ | Developer |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| `May 2016` | LZW is compression algorithm is technoque which compresses any dataset without any prior knowledge on the dataset. The sample dataset achieved a compression ratio of 0.38. The higher the redundancy, the higher the ratio. Using this algorithm we can compress any given data to get compressed files. [_*Link to project*_](https://github.com/kaush4l/LZW-Compression). |


| _*Android Application*_ | Developer |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| 
| `May 2016` | Mobile Application development has helped me learn build Android application and deploy them. Many hybrid applications were also built using Framework 7, Cordova and Ionic. These application were developed for Android, iOs and Windows mobile simultaneously. Many applications were developed through out the course which hepled in gaining good grip on the subject. Applications were also developed to use technologies like FireBase developer API's. |
