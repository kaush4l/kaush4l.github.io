# Dynamic Resume Application using Next.js (DRAuN)

The goal is to learn next.js, create a dyamic resume application that uses md files to load the resume contents.


# Personal Notes

There is no index.html or the main page like older react. The folder structure is used as routing app is the head and each folder should have either a page.js or route.js to indicate what to return or render. 
layout.js can be used to provide the standard header and footer. The sub folders can have their own layout.
The page will automatically be nested in layout.
