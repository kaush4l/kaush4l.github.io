# Instructions to update the resume

Built using React 17 and material UI. This is a learning page and will be updated based on any new things I want to learn and apply. This version changes the existing class based react components to functional and also used the new Material UI css.

## Update the dependencies
If the app fails to start it can be because of issues in the dependencies
* To update the dependencies run
~~~
  npm aduit
  npm audit fix --force
~~~

## Commands to host
Hosting ReactJS on github is done using gh-pages. All the changes are pushed to the branch called gh-pages and hosted from the branch.
Commands to push to gh-pages

~~~
  npm run deploy // pushes changes to the gh-pages branch and hosts it from there

## TODO list

### Immediate
* A Home page with a theme or a gif picture like [this](https://christopher.su/)
* Update the experiences and projects(UI and content)

### Later
* Try adding all the side projects so that they are easily accessible
* Convert to materialUI and draggable components
